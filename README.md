# 28-Pins-Arduino!
Created a Replica of an Arduino Uno Board with modifications (listed below)

●	Utilized Altium Designer to create schematic, 3D components, PCB model and enhanced board by adding a user button, micro-USB (to allow charging from other devices) and a DFU Disable jumper.

●	Modified 16U2 and 328P Reset Pins to be driven through an open drain buffer meaning the RESET quality has been improved and allows for debugging microcontrollers through the dWire. 

●	Documented and replicated all elements of the design process including costs, schematic, assembly drawing and 3D PCB Model.
